There once was a big bad wolf in the woods. He loved to prey on little piggies who also lived in the woods. One day, 3 little piggies each decided to make a house. The first piggie made his house out of hay, the second out of wood, and the third out of brick.

The three little piggies were all hanging out in the first piggies house made of hay. They were having a birthday party celebrating all of their birthdays. It was time for cake and presents, so they lit the candles and all sang happy birthday to themselves and each other. When it was time to blow out the candles, suddenly they heard a noise from ouside. "I will huff, I will puff, and I will blow the house down!" yelled teh wolf as he blew away the entire hay house. The piggies retreated to the stick house and were sad that the candles were blown out by the wolf instead of them.
